### Summary
I'm an IT student with strong abilities in database modeling and design, with a special emphasis on the business field. I have basic knowledge on accounting and administration, this helps me to understand business processes and, therefore, developing a better solution, whether it is creating a simple database or a more complete one with stored procedures. My goal is to become a database administrator and, as a second priority, a front end developer. I wish to be qualified enough to be able to manage important and complex projects, while improving my leadership skills.
